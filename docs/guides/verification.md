# Verification

The merge gate is **local**. Grok Bot runs it on the machine that has the
Release tree and checkpoints (`AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/skills/verify-local/SKILL.md`).
GitHub Actions compiles, lints, and runs `ctest`. It does not run PyTorch ULP,
convert round-trip, or `verify_diffusion.py` on pull requests. Dispatch
`.github/workflows/parity.yml` only when you want a runner copy of those
commands.

## Release gates

| Gate | Proves |
|---|---|
| Kernel/unit tests | C++ kernels match independent references |
| PyTorch parity | Same checkpoint/input stays within ULP and relative-error limits |
| Relay process test | Real client, shared memory, daemon, deadline result, shutdown |
| Generic process test | Real child service, typed success/rejection, backpressure, shutdown |
| Worker-pool tests | Parallel lanes, freshness, QoS, rolling drain, quarantine, recovery |
| Action-delivery tests | Chunk shape, replacement, timing, freshness, bounds, delta limits |
| Mamba adapter tests | Exact migrated output and real-model generic routing |
| Job observability tests | Fixed event capacity, kinds, progress, migration, timings, exporters |
| Trace round-trip | Canonical bytes for action and generic job records |
| Install consumer | Installed `FlowEdge::Core` and `FlowEdge::Relay` configure, link, run |

## Run everything

Linux / Git Bash (Grok Bot local execution):

```bash
./scripts/verify_all.sh models/mamba_flow.safetensors
```

Windows PowerShell against `build-win-clang`:

```powershell
powershell -File scripts/verify_local.ps1 -BuildDir build-win-clang
```

The script builds Core, Relay, tests, benchmarks, every C++ example, generic-job JSONL inspection,
the Relay lifecycle demo, action replay, all metric formats, installation, and a downstream consumer.
Python checks run when their dependencies are available. Transformer HF parity runs when
`models/tiny-gpt2` and the converted checkpoint are present.

GitHub Actions also runs `.github/workflows/bench.yml` for short CPU kernel JSON
(and GPU only when `nvidia-smi` works). That summary is not policy evidence.

## Focused commands

| Need | Command |
|---|---|
| C++ tests | `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` |
| Transformer kernels | `./build/flowedge_tests --gtest_filter='Gelu*:LayerNorm*:Softmax*:CachedCausalAttention*:Transformer.*'` |
| Transformer HF parity | `python -m flowedge_dev verify transformer models/tiny-gpt2 models/tiny-gpt2.flowedge.safetensors --binary build/transformer_forward` |
| Transformer latency | `build/transformer_latency models/tiny-gpt2.flowedge.safetensors --threads 0 1 2 3 4` |
| PyTorch parity | `python -m flowedge_dev verify ulp models/mamba_flow.safetensors` |
| External-head + streaming smoke | `python -m flowedge_dev verify head build` |
| Diffusion python | `python -m flowedge_dev verify diffusion build` |
| CUDA DP mix | `./build-cuda/flowedge_cuda_dp_mix models/diffusion_pusht.flowedge.safetensors` |
| Policy vs LeRobot | `python -m flowedge_dev bench policy ...` |
| Period rollout | `python -m flowedge_dev pipeline rollout ...` |
| Relay lifecycle | `FLOWEDGE_BUILD_DIR=build ./scripts/relay_demo.sh models/mamba_flow.safetensors` |
| Formatting/static analysis | `FLOWEDGE_BUILD_DIR=build ./scripts/lint.sh` |
| Benchmarks | `FLOWEDGE_BUILD_DIR=build ./scripts/bench.sh` |
| Relay benchmarks | `FLOWEDGE_BUILD_DIR=build ./scripts/relay_bench.sh` |
| QoS overload | `./build/flowedge_job_qos_bench 1000000` |

## Key invariants

| Invariant | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Older generations cannot publish as current | Scheduler, head-pool, job-pool cancellation tests |
| Full result rings cannot lose work | `JobTransport.PreservesTypedResultsAcrossOutputBackpressure` |
| Admission includes active and queued lanes | Multi-lane EDF tests |
| Migration is exact and corruption-safe | Cooperative capsule and Mamba cross-engine tests |
| Draining cannot strand accepted work | Worker drain handoff and queued-work tests |
| Lower service classes cannot consume reserved slots | QoS reservation and equal-deadline tests |
| A failed lane cannot silently rejoin | Quarantine and explicit-recovery tests |
| Trace bytes are portable | Representative little-endian byte assertions |
| Event overflow is bounded | `JobEvents.BuffersValidatedLifecycleRecordsWithoutGrowth` |
| Job metrics keep fixed kinds | `JobMetrics.RecordsKindsProgressPreemptionMigrationAndLatency` |
| Hot paths allocate nothing | Relay and cooperative-job benchmarks |
| Queue depth does not multiply clock reads | Deadline queue benchmark |
| Live handoff remains bounded | Worker drain benchmark |
| Controller publication stays bounded | Action delivery benchmark and multi-rate example |
| Public API works after install | `test/install_consumer` |

## Install consumer

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix build/install-check
cmake -S test/install_consumer -B build/install-consumer \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PWD/build/install-check"
cmake --build build/install-consumer -j
./build/install-consumer/flowedge_install_consumer
```

New kernels, protocols, adapters, event types, and exporters require a focused test plus inclusion in
`verify_all.sh` when they add a runnable surface.

## CUDA kernel loop

One hypothesis per rebuild. Keep the patch only when the targeted
`flowedge_cuda_dp_mix` isolate row **and** native 10-step DDIM p50 both move.
If isolate moves and native does not, revert (#178). Then run matched CUDA
policy replay vs PyTorch; max abs must stay within the existing 1e-3 gate.

```bash
./build-cuda/flowedge_cuda_dp_mix models/diffusion_pusht.flowedge.safetensors
# patch the hottest remaining census/mix row in src/core/kernels/cuda/kernels_cuda.cu
./build-cuda/flowedge_cuda_dp_mix models/diffusion_pusht.flowedge.safetensors
python -m flowedge_dev bench policy models/diffusion_pusht.flowedge.safetensors \
  --source models/diffusion_pusht --device cuda --build-dir /path/to/cuda-build \
  --observations bench/artifacts/policy/diffusion-pusht-cpu-replay.observations.npz
```

Do not retry L=16 conv split-K without a new launch shape; it lost twice.
Do not replace the README `threads=1` 851 vs 1409 ms CPU figure from a CUDA mix.
Do not replace the published GTX 1650 **131 vs 345 ms** CUDA replay from a mix
or a new GPU. Residual fusion and BF16/FP16 weight traffic use the same gate:
isolate **and** native 10-step DDIM (or matched policy p50) on a card that can
`cudaMalloc` the U-Net. A 4 GB GTX 1650 WDDM/WSL host is not that card.
