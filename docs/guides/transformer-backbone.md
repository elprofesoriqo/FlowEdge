# Fixed-shape Transformer baseline

FlowEdge has an experimental general causal Transformer decoder beside Mamba.
It is a fixed-shape, batch-one CPU baseline for the GPT-style contract in
[issue #10](https://github.com/elprofesoriqo/FlowEdge/issues/10). It is not a
generic Hugging Face loader, a production backend, or a SmolVLA implementation.

## Contract

The checkpoint carries an explicit `transformer.config` F32 vector:

`[vocab, d_model, n_layers, n_heads, max_sequence, mlp_dim]`.

Tensor names are deliberately FlowEdge-native: token and learned-position
embeddings, pre-attention and pre-MLP affine LayerNorms, fused QKV projections,
attention output projections, GELU MLP projections, and final LayerNorm. All
KV buffers are allocated at initialization as `[layer][position][hidden]`.

`run(tokens)` resets and fills that cache. `step(token)` appends one key/value
per layer and attends only to positions through the current token. No synthetic
C++ checkpoint fixture is used as release evidence; an actual converted policy
and a matched reference replay are required before this baseline can be called
deployed.

The C and Python APIs also expose `run_embeddings`, which accepts caller-owned
`[sequence, d_model]` F32 rows and runs the same reset-and-prefill path. An
optional batch-one prefix `attention_mask` (`1` values followed by padding `0`
values) makes the condition-sequence boundary explicit for VLA adapters. This
is groundwork for SmolVLA; it does not implement cross-attention, the VLM, or
the current SmolVLA action expert.

The converter is exercised with the downloaded `sshleifer/tiny-gpt2` checkpoint
at revision `5f91d94bd9cd7190a9f3216ff93cd1dd95f2c7be`. It compares a Hugging
Face hidden states against native full-prefix and streaming execution on prefix
`[1,2,3,4]`:

```bash
python tools/verification/verify_transformer_reference.py \
  models/tiny-gpt2 models/tiny-gpt2.flowedge.safetensors \
  --binary build/transformer_forward \
  --output bench/artifacts/transformer/tiny-gpt2-transformer-reference.json
```

This validates real checkpoint conversion, full-prefix execution, and streaming
KV-cache parity only; it is not an action-policy, latency, or SmolVLA result.

Verify the external-embedding boundary against the same real checkpoint (the
Python module must be built with `FLOWEDGE_PYTHON=ON`):

```bash
python tools/verification/verify_transformer_embeddings.py \
  models/tiny-gpt2.flowedge.safetensors --module-path build \
  --output bench/artifacts/transformer/tiny-gpt2-transformer-embeddings.json
```

Check that the real checkpoint's streaming path performs no heap allocation
after initialization:

```bash
build/flowedge_model_lifecycle_check models/tiny-gpt2.flowedge.safetensors \
  --stream 1 2 3 4 --cycles 3
```

## SmolVLA preflight

SmolVLA is architecturally different from the baseline: it has a visual-language
encoder and an action expert with RMSNorm, RoPE, grouped-query self/cross
attention, and SwiGLU. `tools/smolvla_preflight.py` validates the exact tensor
layout of the pinned `lerobot/smolvla_base` checkpoint before conversion:

```bash
python tools/smolvla_preflight.py models/smolvla_base/model.safetensors \
  --config models/smolvla_base/config.json --hash \
  --output bench/artifacts/smolvla/smolvla-base-preflight.json
```

The resulting manifest establishes the real-source contract only. Native
support is the cached-expert plugin (`--policy.type=flowedge_smolvla`), not a
full VLM. The encoder stays in LeRobot.

The first native action-expert boundary is now implemented for the real
checkpoint: action projection, the exact SmolVLA sine/cosine timestep embedding,
the time MLP, and checkpoint-derived dimensions. Verify it against PyTorch with:

```bash
python tools/verification/verify_smolvla_action_expert.py \
  models/smolvla_base/model.safetensors \
  --module-path build-research \
  --output bench/artifacts/smolvla/smolvla-action-expert-suffix.json
```

This artifact is projection parity only. It does not execute the VLM image or
language encoder, cached-VLM self/cross-attention replay, or a policy rollout.

With the upstream VLM weights available locally, capture a separate source
policy-construction record:

```bash
python tools/verification/verify_smolvla_source.py models/smolvla_base \
  --output bench/artifacts/smolvla/smolvla-base-upstream-load.json
```

This proves only that the pinned upstream `SmolVLAPolicy` can construct from
the local checkpoint. It is not FlowEdge inference or an action-quality result.

## SmolVLA source-parity capture contract

To validate the captured VLM cache and native action expert, export a source action chunk from a
real observation captured through the upstream LeRobot processor. The `.npz`
capture must contain batch-one, pre-processor tensors:

- `observation.state`: F32 `[1, 6]`;
- one or more configured `observation.images.*` fields: F32 `[1, 3, height, width]`
  RGB values in `[0, 1]`. Keep each real camera at the resolution emitted by
  the source pipeline; SmolVLA performs its own resize-with-padding. Do not
  duplicate a view to fill an absent camera;
- `observation.language.tokens`: I64 `[1, 48]`; `observation.language.attention_mask`:
  boolean `[1, 48]`, emitted by LeRobot's tokenizer.
- `noise`: F32 `[1, 50, 32]`, captured once and reused by every implementation.

For cached-expert replay, add `noisy_actions` (F32 `[1, 50, 32]`) and
`timestep` (F32 `[1]`); they identify one actual source denoising step.

For a recorded LeRobot v3 parquet/video sample, create this capture without
resizing or duplicating camera pixels. Map only the cameras actually present
in the record to the checkpoint's configured keys:

```bash
python tools/verification/capture_lerobot_frame.py models/smolvla_base data.parquet \
  --frame-index 0 --task "Recorded task" --noise-seed 17 \
  --camera observation.images.camera1=top.mp4 \
  --camera observation.images.camera2=wrist.mp4 \
  --dataset-id namespace/dataset --dataset-revision COMMIT --dataset-license SPDX \
  --output real-observation.npz --manifest real-observation.json
```

`--frame-index` identifies the parquet row. When a video shard starts at a
different dataset index, pass its local ordinal with `--video-frame-index`.

```bash
python tools/verification/export_smolvla_reference.py \
  models/smolvla_base real-observation.npz \
  --output smolvla-source-action.npz \
  --manifest smolvla-source-action.json
```

The exporter does not synthesize defaults and rejects missing, reshaped, or
non-RGB-range inputs. Its action chunk and JSON digests form the later
FlowEdge parity target.

### Cached-VLM action-expert replay

For the native expert boundary, preserve one real denoising input in the same
capture as `noisy_actions` (`F32 [1, 50, 32]`) and `timestep` (`F32 [1]`). The
exporter builds the upstream prefix once, retains its RoPE-applied VLM K/V
cache, and records the expected expert hidden state and velocity. It does not
fill in missing values:

The source cache is `[1, prefix, 5, 64]` per layer and is transported to
FlowEdge as `[16, prefix, 320]`. Its validity mask may be sparse: LeRobot
right-pads language tokens before appending the valid state token. The replay
verifier therefore compares BF16 hidden states with a `0.1` maximum-error
default, action velocity with `0.08`, and the ten-step Euler result with
`0.03`. These are explicit cross-runtime BF16 envelopes, not accuracy or
task-quality thresholds.

```bash
python tools/verification/export_smolvla_expert_reference.py \
  models/smolvla_base real-observation.npz \
  --output smolvla-expert-reference.npz \
  --manifest smolvla-expert-reference.json

python tools/verification/verify_smolvla_cached_expert.py \
  models/smolvla_base/model.safetensors smolvla-expert-reference.npz \
  --module-path build-research \
  --output bench/artifacts/smolvla/smolvla-cached-expert.json
```

The report is the required evidence for the cached-VLM action-expert path. It
does not validate preprocessing, VLM encoding, the full ten-step flow solve,
timing, or control quality.

### Cached-VLM Euler trajectory replay

The native `smolvla_sample` call implements the source's deterministic Euler
schedule (`t = 1 - step / N`, `x += -v / N`) from caller-owned noise. Add the
same real `noise` input used by the upstream action call to produce a complete
trajectory target from the cached VLM prefix:

```bash
python tools/verification/export_smolvla_expert_reference.py \
  models/smolvla_base real-observation.npz \
  --output smolvla-expert-reference.npz \
  --trajectory-output smolvla-trajectory-reference.npz

python tools/verification/verify_smolvla_cached_trajectory.py \
  models/smolvla_base/model.safetensors smolvla-trajectory-reference.npz \
  --module-path build-research \
  --output bench/artifacts/smolvla/smolvla-cached-trajectory.json
```

This establishes expert-side Euler replay from an externally generated cache.
The source-pipeline boundary can also be exercised end to end through the
installed LeRobot provider and compared against the source action chunk:

```bash
python tools/verification/verify_smolvla_hybrid.py \
  models/smolvla_base/model.safetensors models/smolvla_base \
  bench/artifacts/smolvla/eslab-frame-000000.capture.npz \
  --module-path build-research \
  --output bench/artifacts/smolvla/eslab-frame-000000.hybrid-action.json
```

The resulting report covers source LeRobot image/state/language preprocessing,
the source VLM prefix/cache provider, and the native FlowEdge action expert for
the full `50 x 6` action chunk. It remains source-owned preprocessing/VLM plus
native expert execution: this is not native VLM/full-native SmolVLA evidence,
and it makes no latency, control-quality, or task-success claim.

`--policy.type=flowedge_smolvla` registers that boundary as a LeRobot policy
type. The VLM stays in LeRobot; FlowEdge executes the native expert.

```bash
python -m pip install -e 'integrations/lerobot[smolvla]'
```

```bash
build/flowedge-inspect models/smolvla_base/model.safetensors --json
```

The report identifies `family: "smolvla"` and explains that the LeRobot
preprocessing boundary and VLM encoder are not implemented natively. The
action expert can consume an external cache, while the hybrid report verifies
the source provider-to-native-expert seam; neither is a claim of native full
SmolVLA support.

For a portable evidence artifact, run the verifier against the same binary:

```bash
python tools/verification/verify_smolvla_inspection.py \
  models/smolvla_base/model.safetensors \
  --binary build/flowedge-inspect \
  --output bench/artifacts/smolvla/smolvla-base-inspection.json
```
