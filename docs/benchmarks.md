| Suite | Location | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Kernels | `bench/kernels/` | Dense ops, including DP Conv1D shapes |
| Runtime | `bench/runtime/` | Relay admission, queues, delivery |
| Flow matching vs PyTorch | `python -m flowedge_dev verify ulp` | ULP / rel-error on `mamba_flow` — not a p50 |
| Diffusion Policy vs PyTorch | `python -m flowedge_dev bench policy` | Same observations, processor, noise, DDIM vs LeRobot |
| Period loop | `python -m flowedge_dev pipeline rollout` | `--period-ms`, `--on-miss`, RSS; `--device cuda` on a CUDA Core build |
| Closed loop | `flowedge_lerobot.evaluate` | PushT outcome — not a timing proof |
| SmolVLA expert | `python -m flowedge_dev verify smolvla` | Cached-VLM expert vs source; VLM stays in PyTorch |
| Transformer fixture | `python -m flowedge_dev verify transformer`, `transformer_latency` | GPT-2 smoke vs Hugging Face; host decoder p50 is not a policy result |
| ONNX companion | `integrations/onnx` | Fixed-shape ORT adapter; measure separately |

The two product heads are flow matching and Diffusion Policy. Without FlowEdge
you keep them in PyTorch/LeRobot or a graph compiler. With FlowEdge you convert
the head, pin RSS, and compare against that same PyTorch reference. Mix ULP
with p50 and the claim is wrong. [Performance](performance).

## Canonical policy report

```text
python -m flowedge_dev bench policy models/policy.safetensors \
  --source models/diffusion_pusht \
  --revision <immutable-hf-revision> \
  --steps 10 --iterations 100 --warmup 5 --threads 1 \
  --output bench/artifacts/policy/diffusion-pusht-report.json
```

JSON + Markdown together. Reference is LeRobot/PyTorch; candidate is FlowEdge native.

## Interpretation

| Claim | Allowed when |
|---|---|
| PyTorch speedup | Same checkpoint, processor, host, threads, schedule |
| Real-time | Full period, delivery path, miss counts |
| Zero hot allocations | Native path instrumentation |
| Hardware result | Artifact names the board |

**CPU available · CUDA matched PushT replay on GTX 1650 · Tenstorrent planned**. CUDA policy p50 is not the README CPU headline. Not TensorRT/ONNX. Not Jetson/ARM ([#70](https://github.com/reforcemind/FlowEdge/issues/70)).
