# Fake-robot CUDA period loop

> One host, one converted `diffusion_pusht` checkpoint, CUDA Core, simulator seam only. Not Jetson, not SO-100, not a PyTorch compare, not a success-rate claim.

Every 10 ms period missed. Synthetic encoded zeros; the RGB encoder stays in LeRobot. No warmup; the first step is the cold tail. Joint-limit clamps were not applied. This is not the matched CUDA replay p50 (420 ms vs PyTorch CUDA 346 ms) and not Jetson/ARM.
